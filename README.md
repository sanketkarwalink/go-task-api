# Go Task API

A simple RESTful Task Manager API built with **Go**.  
Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks stored in a local JSON file.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Create** a new task  
- **Get all** tasks  
- **Get a task by ID**  
- **Update** a task by ID  
- **Delete** a task by ID  
- Stores tasks in a `tasks.json` file (no external DB required)

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

This project demonstrates how to build a simple but complete RESTful API in Go with proper separation of concerns, clean code structure, and persistent storage.

Itâ€™s designed as a **portfolio project** to showcase skills in:

* Backend API development with Go
* REST API design
* File-based storage handling
* Modular code organization
* JSON data handling in Go

---

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

These are possible enhancements to make the project more advanced:

* Switch from JSON file storage to a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* Add user authentication (JWT-based login)
* Deploy API to a cloud provider (AWS, Render, Railway, etc.)
* Add unit tests for all API routes
* Implement pagination for large task lists
